# My First Website Project ðŸš€

A beginner's experiment to learn the fundamentals of web development and how to use Git and GitHub.

## About the Project
This repository serves as a learning sandbox where I'm exploring the basics of creating a static website. My goal is to understand how to structure a web page using **HTML**, style it with **CSS**, and manage the project's code using **Git**.

## Features
- **Minimalist Design:** A simple, clean aesthetic with a focus on core content.
- **Responsive Layout:** The website is designed to be viewable on different screen sizes. (Optional - if you've added this)

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For the basic structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS:** For styling and visual presentation.
